Basically, I'm starting with myself. I have lots of interest in lots of things, I even don't know why, but anything related to science or tech, I can't hold myself away from it. This describes why I'm into computers. Long story short, I do software development. I love open source community lot (I will explain it later). Right now I'm doing Google Summer of Code with GNOME organization.",
